# reporting and dealing with security issues

well... hacking (as in exploiting vulnerabilities/pentesting) rocks and I support it. I even agree with black-hat hacking. But shit can
go wild when a black-hat hacker discovers a vulnerability. Do not take this script seriously, it has bugs and it will have them. Run it
in closed localhost environments.

That being said; if you found a vulnerability (memory leaks, etc.), please submit an issue or, even better, a pull request with
a fix. Everything is welcome!

I am bored a lot actually, so I may fix your issues and hacks rather quickly.
